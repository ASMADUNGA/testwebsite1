Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday the situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut is "the most difficult out of all" areas in Ukraine amid intense shelling. Ukrainian officials said they have limited civilian and press access to the city for security reasons. 
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during the ongoing NATO defense ministers’ meeting that there’s no indication Moscow is massing aircraft to prepare for a "massive aerial attack" — but he underscored the potential danger.
Meanwhile, the UK's defense minister said the delivery of British fighter jets to Ukraine is likely years away and training Ukrainian pilots is aimed at "long-term resilience."
A US report alleges Moscow is operating a network of camps holding thousands of Ukrainian children, which the Russian Embassy in Washington dismissed.
